## Task 1: Data Management - Line Dataset Generation
Create a numpy zeroes array of size 28x28. Then starting from a random (row, col) draw a line of length {7, 15} and width {1, 3}. Fill this line with color {(255,0,0), (0,0,255)}. Now rotate this line with Image.rotate() function of PIL to required angles and save the images in corresponding class folders using Image.save().
